# Personal website of<br>Antonio Martinko

👨‍🎓 Hello everybody to the repository made for [my personal website](https://antonio-martinko.netlify.app)!

I made this academic website (after many trial and error🙇️) in RStudio using the [Blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/index.html) R package and the [Hugo Apéro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/).

This repository is kept public so that you can discover the contents of the repository at your own convenience and learn how to recreate anything for your own site. That is also how I learned and also, by following certain tutorials!🔓

Specifically, I will mention:
[Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/),
[Silvia Canelón](https://www.silviacanelon.com/blog/2021-hello-hugo-apero/?panelset=my-ap%25C3%25A9ro-site), [Shilaan Alzahawi](https://shilaan.rbind.io/post/building-your-website-using-r-blogdown/)

⚠️ If possible, duplication of my site should be avoided without permission. If you decide to duplicate certain parts I urge you to consider that your site should reflect your own unique style! Therefore, copy available parts of the code but thereafter change it to your preferences.

Thank you for taking the time to read this file and enjoy the ride!🚴
