Don't worry, I won't take long!

I'm an assistant and a doctoral candidate at the [Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb](https://www.kif.unizg.hr/en). Broadly, my research interests include physical activity, health, obesity and fitness. I work in the [Physical Activity Measurement and Surveillance Laboratory](https://www.kif.unizg.hr/en/research/laboratory/physical_activity_measurement_and_surveillance_laboratory) and on projects that deal with research and development of objective methods for measuring physical activity and monitoring the population level of physical activity. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
