  Since I've been introduced to [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) I've been continuously playing with it and what it can do for me and others. Until now this has only influenced the way I do data analysis and now I think it is time to take it further. Therefore, I decided to make this web page and try to help people with problems in several areas of life. To conclude, follow my [blog](/blog) and educational content in [publications](/publication) for all things science, health, physical activity and an occasional rant on things that I'm interested in.
